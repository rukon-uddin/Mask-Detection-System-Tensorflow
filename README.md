# Mask-Detection-System-Tensorflow
### Colab version.
If you don't have gpu no problem I too don't have one. But google is at the rescue, Google colab is where they offer free GPU access and my project has been done in google colab. 

We all have felt the pressure that Covid-19 has exerted on our physical, economical and daily life. One of the main precautions that we had to mantain was wearing mask. So i was like why not build a system which can detect if a person is wearing a mask or not!!.

**Implementation**
  - Countries where masks are mandetory to wear. They can use this model to observe or make a statictical observation.
  - Offices that are functional during this pandemic.

**Requirements**
  - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)

Open colab.
Go to `File` **->** `New notebook`. You must enable GPU to speed up the process.

To enable GPU go to `Runtime` **->** `Change runtime type` select `gpu` and click on `SAVE` and you are good to go.

# Dataset
The credit for the dataset goes to this [Repo](https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection)

There are some changes i made to the dataset.
First you have to clone my repo in your colab cloud
```Code
git clone https://github.com/rukon-uddin/Mask-Detection-System-Tensorflow.git
```
